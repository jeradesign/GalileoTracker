    <h2>Face Detector</h2>
    <p><strong>What You&rsquo;re Seeing:</strong><br />
    This face detector draws a red circle around any faces it detects.  (There&rsquo;s a size threshold, so distant faces won&rsquo;t be recognized.)</p>
    <p><strong>How It Works:</strong><br />
    This face detector uses a technique called a <em>cascade classifier</em> to detect faces. The classifier scans across then entire image looking for <em>haar-like features</em> that match those of faces in its training database.  It&rsquo;s called a &lsquo;cascade&rsquo; because each candidate region is run through a cascade of different detectors, any of which can reject it.  A region is only marked as a facepasses if it passes <em>all </em>of the detectors.</p>
    <p><strong>What It&rsquo;s Used For:</strong><br />
    Face detection is widely used in from everything to digital cameras to security applications to digital photo albums.</p>
    <p><strong>Try and Notice:<br />
    </strong>Turn your head to either side, or tilt it slightly.  Note that the face detector no longer recognizes your face.  That&rsquo;s because this face detector was only trained on full-face images.  Other, more sophisticated face recognizers can recognize faces from a wider range of angles.</p>
