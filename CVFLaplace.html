<h2>Laplace</h2>
<p><strong>What You’re Seeing:</strong><br />
This demo takes the <em>Laplace operator</em> (also known as the <em>Laplacian</em>) on each point for the primary colors red, green and blue.  The Laplacian is defined as the sum of the second derivative in the x and y directions.</p>
<p><strong>How It Works:</strong><br />
In OpenCV, the Laplacian function uses the Sobel operator to produce the second derivatives with respect to x and y, and then adds them together.</p>
<p><strong>What It’s Used For:<br />
  </strong>The Laplace operator performs a simple form of edge detection.  Edges appear as black lines surrounded by white areas.</p>
<p><strong>Try and Notice:</strong><br />
Point the camera at an object of a solid color.  Note how the center of the object appears black, while the edges are the color of the the object.</p>
